      Worked inside a data and analytics team, that primarily used Angular.JS, Node.JS, HapiJS, and MongoDB as their tech stack. Then deployment was handled by a kubernetes and docker combo to be deployed to the cloud, along with a Gulp build system to put it all together.
      \n
      Worked on multiple projects ranging from anything to a social networking app for interns and new hires find eachother during lunch. Or a homegrown skill searching website to help employees find other employees with the proper skills to contribute to a project. Even fixing bugs and adding features to a home made spending aggregator, built on top of yet another home grown ETL engine. All the way to tracking, displaying, and querying what product releases are on time or delayed within the company.
      \n
      Also led the charge on my team of bringing their tech stack from old vanilla Javascript in ES5, to the newer class based, async/await features of ES7. Standardized projects in respect to how they are beautified, started, and documented, to help ease the learning curve of people contributing to new projects they have never touched before.
