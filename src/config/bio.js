	University, with my degree in Computer Science,

	eating all the food I can find, and tasting
	local beers. `,

	`In my free time, I try to focus things outside of coding. 
   Lately I have been teaching myself piano, reading, drawing, or 
   Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. If the mood takes me I usually try to dabble in projects that 
   require Machine Learning/AI or mobile development.`
